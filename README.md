CSC 343 Operating Systems Coursework

prisonerd2024:
The first project introduced me to state machines through the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma simulation. I developed a program that dynamically adjusted its strategy based on the game's outcomes, delving deep into state transitions and variable initializations. This exercise not only sharpened my coding skills but also offered a tangible way to grasp the decision-making processes within a simulated environment.

schedualUserKernel2024:
In the second assignment, I expanded my knowledge to include user-to-kernel mode scheduling, where I implemented many-to-one and many-to-many scheduling algorithms. This task required a nuanced understanding of how multiple user threads interact with kernel processes, pushing me to consider efficiency and resource management in a multi-threaded context.

stm3CPUschedSP2024:
The third project was the most challenging, involving the implementation and modification of various thread scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). Each algorithm required a unique approach to process prioritization and resource allocation, building to a deep dive into preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling. By predicting and estimating process burst times, I developed a nuanced understanding of how operating systems optimize task execution and resource utilization.
